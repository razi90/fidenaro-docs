## Our Mission and Audience

Fidenaro is on a mission to demystify the complex world of cryptocurrency trading. By creating a platform that caters to both seasoned traders and newcomers, we aim to bridge the gap in knowledge and experience. Our goal is to develop a symbiotic ecosystem where novice investors can learn from and leverage the expertise of experienced traders, whose performance is transparently showcased through a public ledger. This approach not only fosters a trustworthy trading environment but also cultivates a community where learning and growth are central.

We target a diverse audience, encompassing experienced traders who can showcase their skills and leverage their expertise, as well as newcomers seeking guidance in the crypto world. Additionally, we cater to investors who might not have the time or inclination for active trading and portfolio management but are interested in participating in the crypto market. Our platform is designed to be inclusive and accessible, ensuring that everyone, regardless of their experience level, can navigate and benefit from the world of DeFi.

## Why Fidenaro Stands Out

Our choice to build on Radix stems from its robust development tooling, designed to mitigate the complexities and security vulnerabilities often associated with other smart contract platforms. Scrypto, the language utilized on Radix, enables us to develop high-quality products with a reduced risk of hacks and exploits. This confidence in technology is a cornerstone of Fidenaro, ensuring a secure and reliable platform for our users.

Our platform aims to integrate seamlessly with various projects within the Radix ecosystem, particularly DEXes offering a range of trading options.

## Current Status and Beta Launch

Fidenaro is currently in its development phase, with a recent milestone being the launch of our beta version on the testnet. This early version provides users with a sneak peek of the platform and is a crucial step in gathering valuable feedback for further improvements.

## Looking Ahead

Our roadmap includes careful evaluation and incorporation of user feedback, continuous development of the platform, and preparation for a mainnet launch in the coming months. While our current focus is on basic functionalities like simple swaps, future updates will introduce more sophisticated features like limit orders. A key aspect of our ongoing development is enhancing the user interface and overall experience, ensuring Fidenaro is not only powerful but also intuitive and user-friendly.
